# IT Broadcast Operations & Helpdesk System (G-Report)

G-Report is a comprehensive IT Operations and Helpdesk management system designed to streamline communication between consumers (employees) and IT staff/managers. It features ticket reporting, shift management, knowledge base (Big Book Wiki), and real-time performance tracking.

## 🚀 Features

### for Consumers (Employees)
- **Ticket Reporting**: specific issue categories (Network, Hardware, Software).
- **Rich Forms**: Support for photo uploads, urgency description, and location tagging.
- **Real-time Status**: Track ticket progress (Pending, Handled, Resolved).
- **Knowledge Base**: Access "Big Book" articles for self-service troubleshooting.

### for IT Staff
- **PWA Interface**: Mobile-first design for technicians on the move.
- **Shift Handover**: Structured workflow to pass active issues to the next shift.
- **Routine Checks**: Digital checklist for daily system health checks.
- **Chat & Timeline**: Communicate directly on tickets and view history.

### for Managers
- **Operational Dashboard**: Real-time KPIs (MTTA, MTTR, FCR) and active shift visibility.
- **Shift Management**: Schedule shifts, drag-and-drop interface, CSV import/export.
- **Staff Performance**: Track individual technician performance metrics.
- **Big Book Approval**: Review and approve knowledge base articles submitted by staff.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Go (Golang) with Gin Framework.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with GORM (ORM).
- **Frontend**: Go Templates (HTML/CSS), Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, HTMX.
- **Authentication**: Cookie-based session capability.
- **Deployment**: Docker/Docker Compose ready.

## 🧪 Testing Strategy & Report

We use a modified **Testing Pyramid** strategy to ensure high quality and reliability.

### Strategy
1.  **Unit Tests (Base)**: Test pure logic (e.g., Utils, Crypto).
2.  **Integration Tests (Core)**: Test Handlers, Database, and Middleware interactions using a dedicated test database environment.
3.  **E2E Tests**: Manual or automated browser tests (Playwright/Cypress).

### Current Test Status

| Component | Type | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Crypto Utils** | Unit | ✅ PASS | Password hashing/validation secure. |
| **Auth Module** | Integration | ⚠️ CHECK | Login flow verification. |
| **Consumer Module** | Integration | ⚠️ CHECK | Dashboard & Ticket flow verification. |

### How to Run Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./internal/... -v
```

> [!NOTE]
> Tests require a local PostgreSQL instance. The test suite automatically manages the `it_broadcast_test` database.
